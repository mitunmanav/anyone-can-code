# `GLOSSARY.md` is a plain markdown file with H2-per-term sections. It lives
# at the repo root (project state, not flow-next bookkeeping — survives a
# `rm -rf .flow/`). Subdirectory `GLOSSARY.md` files are supported via
# nearest-ancestor resolution (tsconfig pattern, bounded at the git repo
# root per gitignore convention).
#
# File shape:
#
#     # Glossary
#
#     ## Term Name
#     One or more paragraphs of definition.
#
#     _Avoid_: alias one, alias two
#
#     _Relates to_: [Other Term](#other-term)
#
# Parser invariants:
#   - Fenced code blocks are stripped before heading scan (so `## not a heading`
#     inside a fence is not picked up).
#   - CRLF normalized to LF on parse.
#   - H2 lines (`^## term$`) anchor each entry; everything between this H2
#     and the next H2 (or EOF) is the entry body.
#   - `_Avoid_:` italic line inside an entry yields the alias list.
#   - `_Relates to_:` italic line yields the relationships list (raw lines
#     preserved verbatim — anchor links survive a roundtrip).
#   - Last-term-removal leaves a `# Glossary` husk; never delete the file
#     (Constraints: project state).

    """Return `(strategy_path, repo_root)` for the single-root strategy file.

    Resolves the git repo root from `start` (default cwd) and checks for
    `STRATEGY.md` ONLY at that root. Single-root semantics — strategy is
    repo-wide by Rumelt's definition. Intentionally does NOT walk upward
    from `start`; an `apps/web/STRATEGY.md` (intentional or accidental) is
    ignored, and the repo-root file is the only one downstream skills
    consume regardless of cwd.

    Returns:
      `(repo_root / STRATEGY.md, repo_root)` if the repo-root file exists.
      `(None, repo_root)` if absent — caller can decide whether to refuse
        or guide the user to `/flow-next:strategy`.

    Outside-a-repo behavior: git lookup falls back to `start` itself so
    the check degenerates to "is there a STRATEGY.md in start?" — used by
    `cmd_strategy_status` to return `{exists: false, file_path: null}`
    cleanly without traceback when invoked outside any repository.

    Implementation note: when an explicit `start` is passed, we resolve
    repo_root by running `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` from `start`'s
    directory rather than the process's cwd. This makes the function safe

# fn-52.10 (R16): tracker-key identity grammar.
#
# A tracker key (e.g. "wor" from Linear's WOR-17) is a 1-10 char lowercase
# alnum token whose first char is a letter, mirroring the manual `wor-2-...`
# workunits convention. `fn` is RESERVED for the native scheme — it is matched
# and resolved FIRST everywhere, and a tracker identifier whose lowercased key
# is `fn` is rejected at link/create time (see `reject_reserved_tracker_key`)
# so a tracker can never collide with the native id space.
#
# Three grammars (each defined + tested):
#   (a) alias / bare handle     wor-17            ^[a-z][a-z0-9]{0,9}-\d+$
#   (b) canonical spec id       wor-17-fix-login  ^...-\d+-[a-z0-9-]+$
#   (c) task handle             wor-17.M          (alias) or wor-17-slug.M (canonical)
#
# `parse_id` keeps its int-pair return shape for the native `fn` scheme (callers
# build `f"fn-{n}-..."` from it, so changing the shape would break them). The
# tracker-aware surface lives in `parse_any_id` / `id_sort_key`, and the grammar
# predicates (`is_spec_id` / `is_task_id` / `spec_id_from_task`) route through
# `parse_any_id` so every command that already calls them inherits resolution.

# --- Backend Spec Parser (unified model + effort grammar, fn-28) ---
#
# Spec grammar: ``backend[:model[:effort]]`` — colon-delimited, three parts max,
# trailing parts optional. Examples:
#   - ``rp``                              backend only (RP uses window/session, not per-call model)
#   - ``codex``                           backend only, defaults from registry
#   - ``codex:gpt-5.4``                   backend + model, default effort
#   - ``codex:gpt-5.4:xhigh``             full spec
#   - ``copilot:claude-opus-4.5:xhigh``   copilot with its own effort set
#
# ``BACKEND_REGISTRY`` is a static dict (no plugin discovery). When the registry
# has ``models`` or ``efforts`` set to ``None``, that backend rejects the
# corresponding spec field (e.g. ``rp:opus`` is invalid — RP doesn't accept a
# model). Every validation error lists the valid set sorted alphabetically so
# users get a deterministic, copy-pasteable hint.
#
# Codex ``minimal`` effort caveat: passes codex config validation but the server
# returns 400 when the ``web_search`` tool is enabled. flowctl reviews do not
# enable web_search, so ``minimal`` is safe here — documented for the day we do.

    Prompt-delivery path depends on host platform:

    - **POSIX (macOS / Linux / WSL)** — argv path: ``copilot -p <prompt>
      --resume=<uuid> ...``. ``--resume`` is create-or-resume in this mode,
      so caller doesn't need to track session existence.

    - **Windows** — stdin path: ``copilot --session-id=<uuid> ...`` (or
      ``--resume=<uuid>`` on continuation) with the prompt piped via
      ``subprocess.run(input=prompt, ...)``. The argv path would blow the
      ``CreateProcessW`` 32,767-char cap for spec-sized prompts; Copilot
      CLI (≥1.0.51) has no ``--prompt-file`` / ``@file`` (tracking
      github/copilot-cli#3398), but stdin works and bypasses the cap
      entirely. Stdin mode's ``--resume`` is resume-only (errors with
      "No session matched" on first call), so we use ``--session-id`` for
      the first call and ``--resume`` afterwards — tracked via a touch
      marker under ``.flow/tmp/copilot-sessions/<uuid>``.

    On POSIX, ``COPILOT_ARGV_PROMPT_MAX`` triggers a temp-file scratch
    buffer (hygiene only — the temp file is read back into argv). The
    file is cleaned in ``finally`` so KeyboardInterrupt / TimeoutExpired /
    non-zero exits all unlink.

    ``spec``: a resolved ``BackendSpec`` (backend=copilot). Env-var fills
    happen upstream; ``spec.model`` / ``spec.effort`` are read directly.
    When ``spec`` is ``None`` (defensive / non-review callers), fall back
    to bare-copilot resolution (env + registry defaults).

    Claude-model effort skip: ``--effort`` is dropped when
    ``effective_model`` starts with ``claude-`` (Copilot rejects
    reasoning-effort on Claude-family models).

# wording, update those copies too.

CONFIDENCE_RUBRIC_BLOCK = """## Confidence calibration

Rate each finding on exactly one of these 5 discrete anchors. Do not use interpolated values (no 33, 80, 90).

| Anchor | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| 100 | Verifiable from the code alone, zero interpretation. A definitive logic error (off-by-one in a tested algorithm, wrong return type, swapped arguments, clear type error). The bug is mechanical. |
| 75 | Full execution path traced: "input X enters here, takes this branch, reaches line Z, produces wrong result." Reproducible from the code alone. A normal caller will hit it. |
| 50 | Depends on conditions visible but not fully confirmable from this diff — e.g., whether a value can actually be null depends on callers not in the diff. Surfaces only as P0-escape or via soft-bucket routing. |
| 25 | Requires runtime conditions with no direct evidence — specific timing, specific input shapes, specific external state. |
| 0 | Speculative. Not worth filing. |

## Suppression gate

After all findings are collected:
1. Suppress findings below anchor 75.
2. **Exception:** P0 severity findings at anchor 50+ survive the gate. Critical-but-uncertain issues must not be silently dropped.
3. Report the suppressed count by anchor in a `Suppressed findings` section of the review output.

Example:

> Suppressed findings: 3 at anchor 50, 7 at anchor 25, 2 at anchor 0.

CLASSIFICATION_RUBRIC_BLOCK = """## Introduced vs pre-existing classification

For each finding, classify whether this branch's diff caused it:

- **introduced** — this branch caused the issue (new code, or a pre-existing bug that this diff amplified/exposed in a way that now matters)
- **pre_existing** — the issue was already present on the base branch; this diff did not touch it

Evidence methods (use whatever is cheapest for this diff):
- `git blame <file> <line>` to see when the line was last touched
- Read the base-branch version of the file directly
- Infer from diff context: a finding on an unchanged line in an unchanged file is `pre_existing` by default

**Verdict gate:** only `introduced` findings affect the verdict. A review whose only surviving findings are all `pre_existing` ships.

Report pre-existing findings in a dedicated non-blocking section:

```
## Pre-existing issues (not blocking this verdict)

- [P1, confidence 75, introduced=false] src/legacy.ts:102 — null dereference on empty array
- ...

Never delete pre-existing findings from the report — they stay visible for future prioritization. After the lists, emit a `Classification counts:` line tallying both buckets, e.g.:

> Classification counts: 2 introduced, 4 pre_existing.

# own state. This block is injected alongside the confidence + classification
# rubrics so every review backend (rp, codex, copilot) honors the same hard list.
# Keep synchronized with the three workflow.md files + quality-auditor.md.

PROTECTED_ARTIFACTS_BLOCK = """## Protected artifacts

The following paths are flow-next / project-pipeline artifacts. Any finding recommending their deletion, gitignore, or removal MUST be discarded during synthesis. Do not flag these paths for cleanup under any circumstances:

- `.flow/*` — flow-next state, specs, tasks, epics, runtime
- `.flow/bin/*` — bundled flowctl
- `.flow/memory/*` — learnings store (pitfalls, conventions, decisions)
- `.flow/specs/*.md` — epic specs (decision artifacts)
- `.flow/tasks/*.md` — task specs (decision artifacts)
- `docs/plans/*` — plan artifacts (if project uses this convention)
- `docs/solutions/*` — solutions artifacts (if project uses this convention)
- `scripts/ralph/*` — Ralph harness (when present)

These files are intentionally committed. They are the pipeline's state, not clutter. An agent that deletes them destroys the project's planning trail and breaks Ralph autonomous runs.

If you notice genuine issues with content INSIDE these files (e.g., a spec that contradicts itself, a stale runtime value, a memory entry that's wrong), flag the content — not the file's existence.

**Protected-path filter.** Before emitting findings, scan each for recommendations to delete, gitignore, or `rm -rf` any path matching the protected list above. Drop those findings. If you drop any, report the drop count in a `Protected-path filter:` line in the review output (e.g. `Protected-path filter: dropped 2 findings`). Omit the line when nothing was dropped.

# 1.1.4 / fn-46-follow-up) and tolerates the legacy `## Acceptance` (plan
# template pre-1.1.4) and `## Acceptance criteria` (older lowercase form)
# variants for back-compat. Missing R-IDs flip the verdict to NEEDS_WORK
# unless the spec marks the requirement deferred. The block is injected into
# impl-review and epic-review (completion-review) prompts. Keep synchronized
# with the RP workflow.md files.

R_ID_COVERAGE_BLOCK = """## Requirements coverage (if spec has R-IDs)

If the task or epic spec references an epic spec with numbered acceptance
criteria like `- **R1:** ...`, `- **R2:** ...`, produce a per-R-ID coverage
table. Read the epic spec's `## Acceptance Criteria` section (canonical;
reviewer MUST also tolerate the legacy `## Acceptance` and `## Acceptance
criteria` heading variants for back-compat). If no R-IDs are present
anywhere, skip this block entirely — the rest of the review is unchanged.

For each R-ID, classify status:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| met | Diff clearly implements the requirement with appropriate tests/evidence |
| partial | Diff advances the requirement but leaves gaps (missing tests, missing edge case, missing integration point) |
| not-addressed | Diff does not advance this requirement at all |
| deferred | Spec explicitly defers this requirement to a later task/PR |

Report as a markdown table in the review output:

| R-ID | Status | Evidence |
|------|--------|----------|
| R1 | met | src/auth.ts:42 + tests/auth.test.ts:17 |
| R2 | partial | implementation exists but no error-path tests |
| R3 | not-addressed | — |

After the table, emit one line listing every `not-addressed` R-ID that is NOT
explicitly deferred in the spec:

> Unaddressed R-IDs: [R3, R5]

If there are zero unaddressed R-IDs, emit `Unaddressed R-IDs: []` or omit the
line entirely — both forms are valid. Deferred R-IDs are never listed here.

**Verdict gate:** any `not-addressed` R-ID that is NOT marked `deferred` in the
spec MUST flip the verdict to `NEEDS_WORK`. A clean coverage table (all `met`
or `deferred`) does not by itself force SHIP — the other review gates still
apply.

After the findings list, emit:
- The `## Requirements coverage` table and `Unaddressed R-IDs:` line (only when the spec uses R-IDs; otherwise skip).
- A `Suppressed findings:` line tallying anchors dropped by the gate (omit when nothing was suppressed).
- A `Classification counts:` line tallying `introduced` vs `pre_existing` survivors, e.g. `Classification counts: 2 introduced, 4 pre_existing.`.
- A `Protected-path filter:` line tallying findings dropped by the protected-path filter (omit when nothing was dropped).

Be critical. Find real issues.

**Verdict gate:** only `introduced` findings affect the verdict. A review whose sole surviving findings are all `pre_existing` MUST ship. Any non-deferred `not-addressed` R-ID also forces NEEDS_WORK regardless of other findings.

<verdict>NEEDS_WORK</verdict> - `introduced` issues or unaddressed R-IDs must be fixed

## Review Scope

You are reviewing:
1. **Epic spec** in `<spec>` - The high-level plan
2. **Task specs** in `<task_specs>` - Individual task breakdowns (if provided)

**CRITICAL**: Check for consistency between epic and tasks. Flag if:
- Task specs contradict or miss epic requirements
- Task acceptance criteria don't align with epic acceptance criteria
- Task approaches would need to change based on epic design decisions
- Epic mentions states/enums/types that tasks don't account for

## Review Criteria

1. **Completeness** - All requirements covered? Missing edge cases?
2. **Feasibility** - Technically sound? Dependencies clear?
3. **Clarity** - Specs unambiguous? Acceptance criteria testable?
4. **Architecture** - Right abstractions? Clean boundaries?
5. **Risks** - Blockers identified? Security gaps? Mitigation?
6. **Scope** - Right-sized? Over/under-engineering?
7. **Testability** - How will we verify this works?
8. **Consistency** - Do task specs align with epic spec?

## Verdict Scope

Explore the codebase to understand context, but your VERDICT must only consider:
- Issues **within this plan** that block implementation
- Feasibility problems given the **current codebase state**
- Missing requirements that are **part of the stated goal**
- Inconsistencies between epic and task specs

Do NOT mark NEEDS_WORK for:
- Pre-existing codebase issues unrelated to this plan
- Suggestions for features outside the plan scope
- "While we're at it" improvements

    ``""`` (no usable signal — caller falls back to "return all").

    When ``base_ref`` is provided, the branch-first-commit step uses

    helper falls back to ``git log {branch_name}`` as a best-effort
    behavior; callers without a base context (e.g. unit tests on
    detached fixtures) still get a usable threshold.

    1. ``epic_created_at`` — primary signal (spec metadata).
    2. Earliest non-empty ``tasks[].created_at`` — deterministic given a

    3. ``git log <branch_name> --reverse --format=%cI`` first commit —
       deterministic given a fixed branch + git history; covers specs
       where neither spec nor tasks carry timestamps.
    4. ``""`` — caller returns all entries (graceful-degradation contract;
       same as pre-fn-49.2 behavior for the no-signal case).

    Each step is deterministic and the chain stops at the first success so

# --- Codex implementation-delegation helpers (fn-55.4) ---
#
# Two deterministic, pure helpers that make the implementation-delegation path
# (the `DELEGATE: codex` worker hook) testable. Per the repo's
# agentic-vs-deterministic split (CLAUDE.md), result-schema validation +
# the 5-row classification + scoped-rollback path computation are MECHANICAL,
# so they live here in flowctl — NOT in markdown the host re-interprets (which
# would be untestable). The host AGENT keeps the judgment (delegate-or-not,
# risk→effort, batching); these helpers only compute over (exit code, result
# JSON) and (pre/post untracked snapshots).
#
# Both functions are pure (no git invocation, no filesystem mutation beyond
# reading the snapshot/result inputs), so the mock-codex fixture can drive every
# branch deterministically without a real model or repo mutation.

# The lifted result schema's required keys (codex-delegation.md). A result JSON
# is "valid_schema" only when it is an object carrying EXACTLY these keys (the
# lifted schema is `additionalProperties:false`, R6) with a `status` in the
# status enum. We enforce additionalProperties:false HERE too — not only at
# `--output-schema` generation time — as the backstop for a degraded schema run
# (e.g. MCP re-enabled, #15451): a free-form object with extra fields must read
# as schema-INVALID → task_failure → rollback, never a blind commit.

## Diff Summary
```
{diff_summary}
```

## Review Criteria (Carmack-level)

1. **Correctness** - Does the code do what it claims?
2. **Reliability** - Can this fail silently or cause flaky behavior?
3. **Simplicity** - Is this the simplest solution?
4. **Security** - Injection, auth gaps, resource exhaustion?
5. **Edge Cases** - Failure modes, race conditions, malformed input?

## Scenario Exploration (for changed code only)

Walk through these scenarios for new/modified code paths:
- Happy path: Normal operation with valid inputs
- Invalid inputs: Null, empty, malformed data
- Boundary conditions: Min/max values, empty collections
- Concurrent access: Race conditions, deadlocks
- Network issues: Timeouts, partial failures
- Resource exhaustion: Memory, disk, connections
- Security attacks: Injection, overflow, DoS vectors
- Data corruption: Partial writes, inconsistency
- Cascading failures: Downstream service issues

Only flag issues in the **changed code** - not pre-existing patterns.

## Verdict Scope

Your VERDICT must only consider issues in the **changed code**:
- Issues **introduced** by this changeset
- Issues **directly affected** by this changeset
- Pre-existing issues that would **block shipping** this specific change

Do NOT mark NEEDS_WORK for:
- Pre-existing issues in untouched code
- "Nice to have" improvements outside the diff
- Style nitpicks in files you didn't change

You MAY mention these as "FYI" observations without affecting the verdict.

{R_ID_COVERAGE_BLOCK}
{CONFIDENCE_RUBRIC_BLOCK}
{CLASSIFICATION_RUBRIC_BLOCK}
{PROTECTED_ARTIFACTS_BLOCK}
## Output Format

For each surviving `introduced` finding:
- **Severity**: Critical / Major / Minor / Nitpick (P0 / P1 / P2 / P3 accepted)
- **Confidence**: 0 / 25 / 50 / 75 / 100 (one of the five discrete anchors)
- **Classification**: introduced
- **File:Line**: Exact location
- **Problem**: What's wrong
- **Suggestion**: How to fix

Then, under a separate `## Pre-existing issues (not blocking this verdict)` heading, list each `pre_existing` finding as `[severity, confidence N, introduced=false] file:line — summary`. Never silently drop pre-existing findings.

After the findings list, emit:
- The `## Requirements coverage` table and `Unaddressed R-IDs:` line (only when the spec uses R-IDs; otherwise skip).
- A `Suppressed findings:` line tallying anchors dropped by the gate (omit when nothing was suppressed).
- A `Classification counts:` line tallying `introduced` vs `pre_existing` survivors, e.g. `Classification counts: 2 introduced, 4 pre_existing.`.
- A `Protected-path filter:` line tallying findings dropped by the protected-path filter (omit when nothing was dropped).

Be critical. Find real issues.

**Verdict gate:** only `introduced` findings affect the verdict. A review whose sole surviving findings are all `pre_existing` MUST ship. Any non-deferred `not-addressed` R-ID also forces NEEDS_WORK regardless of other findings.

**REQUIRED**: End your response with exactly one verdict tag:
- `<verdict>SHIP</verdict>` - Ready to merge (no blocking `introduced` findings, all R-IDs met or deferred)
- `<verdict>NEEDS_WORK</verdict>` - `introduced` issues or unaddressed R-IDs must be fixed first
- `<verdict>MAJOR_RETHINK</verdict>` - Fundamental problems, reconsider approach

# --- Validator pass (fn-32.1 --validate) ---
#
# Conservative false-positive drop on NEEDS_WORK review findings. Used by
# `flowctl codex validate` and `flowctl copilot validate`. Shares the prompt
# template (skills/flow-next-impl-review/validate-pass.md) and output parser
# across both backends so receipt shape is identical.
#
# Design note: re-uses the existing backend session via ``session_id`` read
# from the receipt — the validator continues the chat so the model already
# has the diff + primary findings in context. A fresh session would force
# re-embedding the diff (wasteful) and lose the primary-review framing that
# makes the "drop if clearly wrong" judgment calibrated.

VALIDATOR_TEMPLATE_FALLBACK = """# Validator prompt (fn-32.1 --validate)

You are validating review findings for false positives. For each finding below,
independently re-check it against the **current code** and decide whether the
finding is actually valid.

**Conservative bias — only drop findings that are clearly wrong.** When
uncertain, keep the finding. A kept false-positive is cheap; a dropped real bug
is expensive.

For each finding: open the cited file, read ±20 lines around the cited line,
check whether the claimed issue is actually present, and look for guards /
handlers / assumptions that address the concern elsewhere.

Do **not** re-score confidence, re-classify severity, or invent new findings.

Return exactly one line per finding in this strict format:

```
<finding-id>: validated: <true|false> -- <one-sentence reason>
```

Rules:
- One line per finding id. Missing ids default to `validated: true`.
- Use the literal tokens `validated: true` or `validated: false`.

This is a COMPLETION REVIEW - verifying that all spec requirements are implemented.
All tasks are marked done. Your job is to find gaps between spec and implementation.

**Goal:** Does the implementation deliver everything the spec requires?

This is NOT a code quality review (per-task impl-review handles that).
Focus ONLY on requirement coverage and completeness.

## Two-Phase Review Process

### Phase 1: Extract Requirements

First, extract ALL requirements from the spec:
- Features explicitly mentioned
- Acceptance criteria (each bullet = one requirement)
- API/interface contracts
- Documentation requirements (README, API docs, etc.)
- Test requirements
- Configuration/schema changes

List each requirement as a numbered bullet.

### Phase 2: Verify Coverage

For EACH requirement from Phase 1:
1. Find evidence in the diff/code that it's implemented
2. Mark as: COVERED (with file:line evidence) or GAP (missing)

## What This Catches

- Requirements that never became tasks (decomposition gaps)
- Requirements partially implemented across tasks (cross-task gaps)
- Scope drift (task marked done without fully addressing spec intent)
- Missing doc updates mentioned in spec

        + """
## Output Format

```
## Requirements Extracted

1. [Requirement from spec]
2. [Requirement from spec]
...

## Coverage Verification

1. [Requirement] - COVERED - evidence: file:line
2. [Requirement] - GAP - not found in implementation
...

## Gaps Found

[For each GAP, describe what's missing and suggest fix. Include `Confidence: <0|25|50|75|100>` and `Classification: introduced | pre_existing` — `pre_existing` means the gap existed before this epic's branch touched the code and is therefore not blocking.]
```

Pre-existing gaps (code smells or missing features that predate this epic's branch) go under a separate `## Pre-existing issues (not blocking this verdict)` heading and do not gate the verdict.

After the findings list, emit:
- The `## Requirements coverage` table and `Unaddressed R-IDs:` line (only when the spec uses R-IDs; otherwise skip).
- A `Suppressed findings:` line tallying anchors dropped by the gate (omit when nothing was suppressed).
- A `Classification counts:` line tallying `introduced` vs `pre_existing` gaps, e.g. `Classification counts: 1 introduced, 0 pre_existing.`.
- A `Protected-path filter:` line tallying gaps dropped by the protected-path filter (omit when nothing was dropped).

## Verdict

**SHIP** - All requirements covered (all R-IDs met or deferred). Spec can close.
**NEEDS_WORK** - Gaps found (or unaddressed R-IDs). Must fix before closing.

**REQUIRED**: End your response with exactly one verdict tag:
<verdict>SHIP</verdict> - All requirements implemented (R-IDs all met or deferred)
<verdict>NEEDS_WORK</verdict> - Gaps or unaddressed R-IDs need addressing

Do NOT skip this tag. The automation depends on it."""

# --- Trivial-diff triage (fn-29.6) ---
#
# Fast pre-check before full impl-review: judges whether the diff is worth
# a Carmack-level review. Saves rp/codex/copilot calls on lockfile-only /
# release-chore / docs-only / generated-only commits. Conservative:
# "when in doubt, REVIEW" — false SKIPs are strictly worse than false REVIEWs.
#
# Strategy (hybrid, deterministic-first):
#   1. Deterministic REVIEW-override: any file that matches a code path
#      (src/, flowctl.py, *.py/.ts/.js/.go/.rs/.sh/..., etc.) forces REVIEW
#      without an LLM call. This is AC9.
#   2. Deterministic SKIP whitelist: lockfile-only / docs-only / release-
#      chore / generated-only diffs. Tight, narrow match — everything else
#      falls through.
#   3. Optional LLM judge (`--backend codex|copilot`) for ambiguous diffs.
#      When tooling is unavailable, falls through to REVIEW (exit 1).
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  SKIP (verdict=SHIP)
#   1  proceed to full review (verdict not set by triage)
#   2+ error (bad args, tooling unavailable when required, malformed output)

Is this diff worth a full code review?

Answer SKIP only if the diff matches one of:
- Lockfile-only bumps: package-lock.json, bun.lock, pnpm-lock.yaml, yarn.lock, Gemfile.lock, poetry.lock, Cargo.lock, uv.lock (and nothing else)
- Pure release chore: version bump in plugin.json / package.json / Cargo.toml + CHANGELOG entry, no other code
- Pure documentation: only *.md files changed, no executable code
- Pure generated-file regeneration: plugins/flow-next/codex/ (from sync-codex.sh), or other clearly-generated paths
- Pure vendored-asset changes: files under /vendor/, /third_party/, or similarly designated paths

When in doubt, answer REVIEW. A missed review is worse than a skipped chore.

Output exactly one line:
SKIP: <one-line reason>
or
REVIEW: <one-line reason>
