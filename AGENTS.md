# Anyone Can Code - Project Context

## Workflow Snapshot
- Phase: idle
- Route: unknown
- Entry mode: unknown
- Last task: N/A
- Next step: Use front door or `$status`.
- Communication mode: caveman-strict
- Memory mode: mcp-first

## Expectations
- User-visible replies must use caveman-full style across this project at all times.
- Keep technical terms exact, but drop filler and keep output terse.
- Only stop caveman style when user says `stop caveman` or `normal mode`.
- This project uses an evidence-first workflow.
- High-impact uncertainty should pause and ask.
- Verification happens before completion claims.
- Local state lives under `.codex/anyone-can-code/`.

## Current Goal
- Define the next verified build outcome here.

## Project Delivery Model
- Linear is product tracker and human-readable progress mirror.
- Linear project `Anyone Can Code` stores every product request, addition, correction, bug, and release request.
- Search Linear before creating work. Update existing issue instead of duplicating it.
- One Linear issue maps to exactly one Flow-Next spec.
- Chat requirement changes must be written to Linear; Linear edits must reconcile into Flow before implementation resumes.
- Flow-Next is local source of truth for specs, engineering tasks, dependencies, and evidence.
- Development happens only in `.worktrees/dev-*`.
- Candidate validation happens in `.worktrees/test-candidate`; no feature implementation there.
- Root `main` checkout is stable publishing workspace.
- Push locally verified development branches to GitHub for off-machine backup and review.
- Keep `test-candidate` local-only.
- Merge through pull requests; publish/release only from `main`.
- Follow `DEVELOPMENT-WORKFLOW.md`.

## Flow-Next

This project uses Flow-Next for task tracking. Use `.flow/bin/flowctl` instead of markdown TODOs or TodoWrite.

**Quick commands:**
```bash
.flow/bin/flowctl list                # List all specs + tasks
.flow/bin/flowctl specs               # List all specs
.flow/bin/flowctl tasks --spec fn-N   # List tasks for spec
.flow/bin/flowctl ready --spec fn-N   # What's ready
.flow/bin/flowctl show fn-N.M         # View task
.flow/bin/flowctl start fn-N.M        # Claim task
.flow/bin/flowctl done fn-N.M --summary-file s.md --evidence-json e.json
```

**Creating a spec** ("create a spec", "spec out X", "write a spec for X"):

Create one directly — do NOT use `$flow-next-plan` (that breaks specs into tasks). The canonical 7-section spec scaffold lives at `.flow/templates/spec.md` (copied here by `$flow-next-setup`) — read it for the section list, scope ownership, and `## Decision Context` H3 conditional. To customize the scaffold for this project, copy `.flow/templates/spec.md` to `<repo-root>/SPEC.md` and edit there — the discovery cascade prefers it (first match wins): `<repo_root>/SPEC.md` → `<repo_root>/spec.md` → `.flow/templates/spec.md` → bundled plugin template.

```bash
.flow/bin/flowctl spec create --title "Short title" --json
.flow/bin/flowctl spec set-plan <spec-id> --file - --json <<'EOF'
# Title

# ... fill the 7 canonical sections (see SPEC.md / .flow/templates/spec.md)
EOF
```

After creating a spec, choose next step:
- `$flow-next-plan <spec-id>` — research + break into tasks
- `$flow-next-interview <spec-id>` — deep Q&A to refine the spec

**Rules:**
- Use `.flow/bin/flowctl` for ALL task tracking
- Do NOT create markdown TODOs or use TodoWrite
- Re-anchor (re-read spec + status) before every task

**Optional — codebase feature map:** `$flow-next-map` wraps [openclaw/clawpatch](https://github.com/openclaw/clawpatch)'s `clawpatch map` command to build a semantic feature index under `.clawpatch/features/*.json`. When present, `repo-scout` and `context-scout` use it to anchor R-IDs and `Investigation targets` to concrete codebase regions. Provider-free by default; install via `pnpm add -g clawpatch` (Node 22+).
